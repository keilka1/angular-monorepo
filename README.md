# Angular Monorepo Example
This application is a mock enterprise application for managing points of interest (POI) visits on a map. Visitors can select a POI from a list and view that POI on a map. Administrators can view the traffic (how many times a user views that POI) of each POI (coming soon).

This application was created using Angular, Nx Dev Tools, NgRx, Google Maps, and ng2-charts.
